### API->https://developer.spotify.com/console/

• Music Player Search Engine helps users discover desired forgotten songs without a song name 2x faster based on mood, genre, era, etc.

• Automated data extraction using Spotify API to create a SQL Database for Artists, Albums, Songs, Acoustic Features, Popularity, and Images. 

• Developed Recommendation Systems for similar songs using Collaborative Item-Based Filtering and for similar artists using a Deep Learning ResNet-50 model based on album and artist cover.

• Optimised Image Retrieval Search Engine with Bag of Visual Words and Color Histogram Mapping.
